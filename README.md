# 🛡️ DEFENCE-AI  
### Tactical Risk Intelligence System for Soldier Health & Mission Readiness

---

## 🚀 Overview

**DEFENCE-AI** is an AI-powered decision support system designed to assess
**operational risk in soldiers** using physiological and behavioral health indicators.

The system enables **early detection of fatigue, stress overload, and health instability**
to prevent mission failure and ensure soldier safety.

This project combines:
- 🧠 Machine Learning
- ⚙️ FastAPI backend
- 🎛️ High-fidelity cinematic frontend (SPA)
- 📊 Decision intelligence & reporting

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In high-risk military operations, **undetected fatigue or health deterioration**
can lead to:
- Mission failure
- Increased casualties
- Poor decision-making under stress

Current systems lack **real-time, interpretable, AI-driven risk assessment**.

---

## 💡 Solution

DEFENCE-AI analyzes **8 key health parameters** and classifies operational risk into:
- 🟢 LOW
- 🟡 MEDIUM
- 🔴 HIGH

Based on the risk level, the system:
- Generates a **command decision letter**
- Allows **mission clearance** or **recovery advisory**
- Produces a **downloadable official mission report**
